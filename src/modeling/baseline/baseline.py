This file will have the following functions:
- Select 9 planes
- resize planes
- save in some massive list output or something. 
- be able to treat 



0: should we make a new directory of only 9 focal planes?
0.5: should we make a new directory of the resized?
    - this could double up the storage
    - this could double up the storage 
0.75: we could edit the code such that instead of iterating throuhg a physical existing directory, it 
    iterates through a list of the resized images that will be processed. 
    - not going to do this because we need to do alot of code edits to the specific dataloader. 

    SOOO conclusion, is to prompt the user to give them a new directory to store the edited data for the model. 



1. def going to keep all the outputs.
