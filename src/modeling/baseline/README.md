# Baseline: Segmentation model
This model is a segmentation model that has been taken from ____________________

## Setup
Before running the model, a few directories need to be manually created in the user's file system.
- baseline model outputs: This directory will store the outputs of the baseline model. i.e image crops, masks, metadatas, etc.
- prediction ndpa outputs: This directory will store the NDPA files housing the predictions of each of the ndpis
- baseline evaluation results: This directory will hold a txt file of the evaluation metrics calculated with the inputted ndpa files.
- reformatted tiles: This directory will have the same structure as the ndpi tiles directory that stores the output tiles of the image preprocessing. However, the pngs are resized and subsetted to fit requirements of this model.

IDEAA:
- only prompt user for confidence threshold
- create folders and directories on own.

- 

After manually creating those files, 
There are a couple tasks that still need to be done:

Set up necessary directories
